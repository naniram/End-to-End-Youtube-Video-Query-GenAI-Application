# End-to-End-Youtube-Video-Query-GenAI-Application
This is a GenAI application where a user can input the youtube video link and then can ask the queries regarding to the video.  
Here technologies that I've used are: Langchain, Gemini llm, GoogleGenAIEmbeddings, youtube_transcript_api, streamlit, FAISS as  vector store.  
After having all the dependencies installed, to run the app just type 'streamlit run app.py'
